## About the User <!-- This is a scaled down user persona -->
- We were comissioned by the high lords of hip hop - the owners of HHPW - to create this application. Ideally, employees of this fine establishment authenticate through FireBase Oauth, and utilize this system to create/edit incoming orders, add items to said orders, close orders, and catch a peek at the current revenue of a set date range. Payment types and tips are all accounted for.

## Features <!-- List your app features using bullets! Do NOT use a paragraph. No one will read that! -->

- Authenticated users can log in and CREATE orders.
- Authenticated users can READ created orders as well as items associated with them.
- Authenticated users can UPDATE orders. 
- Authenticated users (AUs) can DELETE orders as well as items associated with orders.
